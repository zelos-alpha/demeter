## Install

Demeter is available on pypi, so it's esay to install: 

```bash
pip install zelos-demeter
```

The version there would not be updated frequently, so if you want to get latest version, you can clone the git repo and import locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zelos-alpha/demeter.git
```

## Versions

For now, demeter have two main branch: 

* Versions above 0.3.x: latest version, support uniswap market and aave market. It's a major update, so there are some breaking change. 
* Ver 0.2.x: older version, support uniswap market only. If you mind those breaking change, you can stay in this branch

0.2.x version will only have bug fix. If you insisted to staying in version 0.2.x, you can check out v0.2 branch or latest tag on v0.2.
